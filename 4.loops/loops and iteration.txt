What is loop?
a loop in programming is a structure that allows to execute a block of code
repetedly based on condition. used where we had to perform a task multiple number of times
without writing the same code over and over again.



Types of loops:
Finite loops 
infinite loops
condtional loops.

key component of loops are:
initilization.
condtional
body: block of get executed during each iteration of loops
update or iteration.

loops in javascript:

1. for loop: used when number of itereation is known before hand.

for(initilization; conditon, iteration)
{
    //code to be executed
}

2. while loop: the while loop is used when number of iteration is not known in advanced
and loop should continue as long as the contion is true;

while(condtion)
{
    //code to be executed
}

3. do while loop: it is same as while loop but it guarntee that loop will run once without checking the condition.

do
{

}
while(condition);

4. for in  loop: this loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object

for(let key in object)
{
    //code to be executed
}

example:
const obj={a:1, b:2, c:3};
for(let key in obj)
{
    console.log(` ${key}: ${obj[key]}  `)
    // this ` is backtick
}
       

         or

for(let i in obj)
{
    console.log(i ,'=' , obj[i]);
}

5. for of loop: this loop used to iterate over iteratable object (like objects, strings, map, and sets)
   
   const arr=[10,20,30]
   for (let value of arr)
   {
    console.log(value)
   }

for of value print karta hai and for in keys print karta hai.

   controlled statements in loops:
   1.break: exit the loop
   2.continue: skip the current iteration and continue the next one.

   example:

   for(let i=0; i<8; i++)
   {


 if(i==4)
 continue;
 if (i==8)
 breake;

 console.log(i);

   }
