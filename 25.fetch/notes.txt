Api is a set of rules and protocols allows different software application to communicate with each other, enabling developers to access and retrieve data from various sources.

APIs often use JSON to send and receive data, but they can also use XML or other formats.

Many APIs return data in JSON format because it is easy to work with in JavaScript and other programming languages.

For example, when you fetch data from a weather API, it may return JSON data like this:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "temperature": "25Â°C",
  "humidity": "60%",
  "city": "New York"
}


API requests in JavaScript is by using the Fetch API. In this article, we will explore what the Fetch API is, how it works, and I'll provide practical examples to guide you through fetching data from an API using this powerful tool.


How the Fetch API Works
_______________________

fetch api is a modern js interface for making network request, primily design to replace older xmlHTTPrequests.
it provides more straightforward and flexible way to handle http request, making it easier for developers to work with apis and fetch data server.


fetch()- takes one mandatory argument the url, you can also include second argument as an object.
where you can specify various settings such as the HTTP method, headers, and more.

Example:
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

  In this example, we're fetching data from https://api.example.com/data. The then() method is used to handle the response, converting it to JSON using the json() method. The second then() block logs the retrieved data to the console, and the catch() block handles errors if the request fails.

  The fetch() function in JavaScript returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object. This Response object represents the HTTP response from the API.

How fetch() Works
When you make a request using fetch(), it does not return the actual data immediately. Instead, it returns a Promise that eventually resolves with the response.

What fetch() Returns
Initially, fetch() returns a Promise.
When the request is successful, the Promise resolves with a Response object.
The Response object does not contain the actual data yet. You need to use methods like .json(), .text(), or .blob() to extract the data.

Example: fetching user data
