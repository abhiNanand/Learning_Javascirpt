duplicate property names are allowed everywhere, including strict mode. 
You can also have duplicate property names in classes. The only exception is private properties, which must be unique in the class body.
you can create an object with these two steps:

Define the object type by writing a constructor function. There is a strong convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter.

When a function is called with the new keyword,
 the function will be used as a constructor. new will

Array Destructuring using rest operator:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(rest);  // Output: [2, 3, 4]

Object Destructuring:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const { name, ...rest } = { name: 'John', age: 25, city: 'New York' };
console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(rest); // Output: { age: 25, city: 'New York' }

function Car(make, model) {
  return { make, model, isElectric: true }; // Explicitly returning an object
}

const car2 = new Car('Tesla', 'Model 3');
console.log(car2); // { make: 'Tesla', model: 'Model 3', isElectric: true }
