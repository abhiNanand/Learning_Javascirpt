to clear console use
localStorage.clear()



localStorage.setItem(a,5);
 VM1125:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined

 The error occurs because you are trying to use the variable a, but it has not been defined anywhere in your code before being used in the localStorage.setItem() method.

localStorage.getItem(a)

When you use localStorage to store data, everything is stored as a stringâ€”even if you store a number, object, or array. This is because localStorage only supports strings natively.


let number = localStorage.getItem('key');
number = parseInt(number);  // Now it's a number


let obj = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(obj));
