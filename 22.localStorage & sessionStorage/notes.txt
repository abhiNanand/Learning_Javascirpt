localStorage.setItem()

javascirpt provide 3 mechanism for storing data to the client-

coockies, session storage, local storage
Eachone had advantage and disadvantage

Local Storage:
-most recent mechanism
-stores larger amount of data
-cannot be deleted even if browser closed
-Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.
-data is stored in key/value pairs.key is name of the data and value is the actual data.
-10mb data
To create a key, you use the setItem() method. This method takes two arguments, the first is the key, and the second is the value you want to store.

localStorage.setItem('key','value');


Now that you have a key, you can store any data you want under that key. The data you store can be any data type that JavaScript supports, including strings, numbers, objects, and arrays.

To store data, you use the setItem() method again. This time, you pass in the key as the first argument and the data you want to store as the second argument.

localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
To retrieve data from Local Storage, you use the getItem() method. This method takes the key as an argument and returns the data that is stored under that key.

localStorage.getItem('key');

to remove
localStronge.removeItem('key');











Cookies:
-oldest and most well-known mechanism.
-simple to use .
-limited to 4kb of data.
-stored data that is not sensitive.

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the users computer. coockies are used to store information about user such as their name, passoword and preference. 

Cookies are  created using hte document.cookie property. this peroperty is used to set , get, and delete cookies.

Setting a cookie
________________

a cookie is set using the setItem() method. accept two argument name of the cookie and value of the cookie. 
document.cookie = "name=tutorialsPoint";
var user = document.cookie.getItem("name");



Session Storage:
-similar to cookies,but data only stored for current session. 
-data deleted when browser closed.
-stores sensitive data.

to use session storage we use sessionStrorage object.

- sessionStroage.setItem("name","tutorials");

-sesssionStorage.getItem("name");

-5mb data 

sessionStorage object returns the number of key/value pairs
this method accepts an index as a parameter and returns the key at that index in the sesssion storage. 

The following code sets a cookie with the name "name" and the value "tutorialsPoint".
