in code editor i had not write doctype head body html. directly wrote  <script>

    console.log("my name is abhi");
 </script> and it working . output is showing in console how this is possible.

 This works because most modern browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, and others, are designed to be very forgiving when it comes to interpreting HTML. Here's why your code still works:

HTML Parsing Tolerance: Browsers automatically infer missing parts of an HTML document. If you donâ€™t include the <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, or <body> tags, the browser assumes them by default and places your code in the appropriate location.

Your code is interpreted as if it were part of the <body> of an implied HTML structure, like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
    <script>
        console.log("my name is abhi");
    </script>
</body>
</html>


    =========================================================================

if i am writing scirpt tag under body tag and doing some operation or printing something in cosole it still working.

Placing the <script> tag inside <body> is very common for inline JavaScript or dynamically manipulating content on the page. This allows you to work with elements that are already loaded.


   in array if we use any function we starts with arrayname.function(), but in object we do Object.function(objectname); why this difference is there any reason .
