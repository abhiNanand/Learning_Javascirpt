// javascript modules is way to organize and reuse code by encapsulating it into seperate files.  it provide an strucutre way to manage dependencies and maintain code clarity in larger projects.

Modules are the peice of codes that are encapsulated in seperate files.
Key Benefits:
Reusability: Write once, use it anywhere.
Encapsulation: Prevent polluting the global namespace.
Maintainability: Break large codebases into smaller, manageable pieces.
Dependency Management: Control what parts of a module are shared and accessible.

 A module is a bundle of code that acts as an interface to provide functionality for other modules to use, as well as being able to rely on the functionality of other modules.
A module exports to provide code and imports to use other code. Modules are useful because they allow developers to reuse code, they provide a stable, consistent interface that many developers can use, and they do not pollute the global namespace.
